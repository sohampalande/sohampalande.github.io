Hi, I'm Soham. Currently, I am a Research Intern in [J.P. Morgan's AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) team working with the Time-Series group on Deep Generative Models to generate synthetic time-series data. 

<strong>Research:</strong> My research interests are motivated by applications in Finance and Healthcare. I am interested in building forecasting machine learning models that are robust to <b> distribution shifts within the time series/sequential/longitudinal data domain </b> i.e. distribution shifts over time. The data can take various forms- images/video, measurements, graphs, natural language etc. but it should have a temporal component i.e. it should be collected over time. I am also interested in deriving meaningful insights (time-series analytics) by synthesizing diverse, noisy time-series datasets.  

<!-- <ul>
  <li class="">Designing mechanisms to <b>define</b> and <b>detect</b> distribution shifts in various types of data in real time</li>
  <li class="">Building models that are <b>robust</b> to such shifts through:
    <ul>
      <li>Continual Learning</li>
      <li>Few Shot Learning</li>
      <li>Synthetic Data Generation</li>
      <li>Loss function engineering</li>
    </ul>

</ul> -->

<strong>Previously:</strong> I recently graduated from [Rutgers University-NB](https://www.rutgers.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was an R&D in intern at [L3Harris](https://www.l3harris.com/) where I worked on developing anomaly detection models.
