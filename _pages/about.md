Hi, I'm Soham. Currently, I am a Research Intern in [J.P. Morgan's AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) team working with the Time-Series group on Deep Generative Models to generate synthetic time-series data. 

<strong>Research:</strong> My research interests lie broadly in statistical machine learning and are motivated by applications in finance and healthcare. I am interested in building <b>scalable</b>, <b>interpretable</b> machine learning models that can generalize well out of distribution to derive insights from diverse, <b>time-varying</b> data sources- images/video, measurements, graphs, speech etc.- while also taking into account the structure of the underlying data and loss surfaces, and can <b>quantify the uncertainty</b> of their predictions. 

I am also interested in adjacent areas such as: few-shot/continual learning, optimization, physics-based models, generative models, clustering/anomaly detection, decision making under uncertainty, time series forecasting, ablation studies, and synthetic data generation.

<strong>Previously:</strong> I recently graduated from [Rutgers University-NB](https://www.rutgers.edu/) majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I was an R&D intern at [L3Harris](https://www.l3harris.com/) where I worked on building anomaly detection models.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
