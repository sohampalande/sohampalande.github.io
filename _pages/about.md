Hi, I'm Soham. I'm currently a research engineer in [J.P. Morgan's AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) group, where I work within the Time Series team.

<strong>Research:</strong>  I study how computational and human models of cognition exhibit **strategic reasoning** in structured, multi-step environments—and their emergence through behavioral evaluation, learned representational structures (from language and fine-tuning), and mechanistic insight in stylized decision-making scenarios involving **uncertainty**, **adaptation**, and **long-term planning**—such as bidding, bluffing, or probabilistic inference—where optimal strategies must be inductively discovered rather than precomputed.

My goal is to understand *when* and *how* models demonstrate intelligent, goal-directed behaviors**, and precisely which internal structures—learned, emergent, or structurally implicit—support these capabilities. This involves behavioral analysis, algorithmic investigation, and mechanistic insight, drawing from **game theory**, **cognitive modeling**, and **computational geometry**. I'm particularly interested in how adaptive reasoning naturally develops in response to incentives, reinforced feedback signals, inductive contexts, and the geometric structure of internal language representations.

Ultimately, through empirical evaluations, my work addresses deeper theoretical questions—such as how models inductively simulate, generalize, or abstract analogously to human cognition in scientific and mathematical reasoning. By studying reasoning within computational systems and natural cognition through a computational lens, I aim to uncover **generalizable principles of intelligent behavior**, enabling the design of more powerful and adaptive systems.


<!-- My interests lie broadly in interpretability for sequential data — both mechanistic and statistical — with applications in finance and healthcare. I'm particularly focused on building <b>scalable</b>, <b>interpretable</b> tools/models for multi-modal models (specifically sequential) that exploit the geometric structure of the underlying data, loss surfaces, and domain-specific mathematical constraints. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
